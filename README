Mail::Miner version 2.1
=======================

If you install Mail::Miner and set it up so that mail is routed through
Mail::Audit::Miner (see the documentation) or piped through mm_process,
then attachments will be replaced by instructions about how to use the
"mm" command-line utility to detach them. You also have a handy database
of all your email that you can prod. :)

See the "mm" tool for more details of how you can search this database
for email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and so on.

INSTALLATION

You will need mysql installed.

To install this module, create a new mysql database according to the
schema in miner.sql, and give yourself access to it. Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Now you have to make sure your incoming mail gets processed by
Mail::Miner. You can do this by putting a pipe to mm_process in your
procmailrc, or, if you're using Mail::Audit, by using
Mail::Audit::Miner. (Included in this distribution.) See the
documentation for that module for more details. 

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

        MIME::Parser
        Date::Manip
        Mail::Address
        Class::DB::mysql
        Lingua::EN::Keywords

SUPPORT

This software is currently unsupported. It hasn't eaten my mailbox, but
I don't want to say it won't eat yours. But I find it useful, and you
might too.
