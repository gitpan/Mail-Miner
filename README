Mail::Miner version 1.0
==========================

If you install Mail::Miner and set it up so that mail is routed through
Mail::Audit::Miner (see the documentation) or piped through mm_process,
then attachments will be replaced by instructions about how to use the
"mm" command-line utility to detach them. You also have a handy database
of all your email that you can prod. :)

See the "mm" tool for more details of how you can search this database
for email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and so on.

INSTALLATION

YOU WILL NEED POSTGRES INSTALLED.

* Earlier versions of M::M used Mysql; this is no longer the case, as
Mysql is not a real RDBMS. It does not support subselects, although
they've apparently been "coming soon" for the past few years. Postgresql
is free and it works; please use it instead of Mysql where you can.

To install this module, create a new Postgres database according to the
schema in miner.sql, and give yourself access to it. Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Now you have to make sure your incoming mail gets processed by
Mail::Miner. You can do this by putting a pipe to mm_process in your
procmailrc, or, if you're using Mail::Audit, by using
Mail::Audit::Miner. (Included in this distribution.) See the
documentation for that module for more details. 

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

        MIME::Parser
        Date::Manip
        Mail::Address
        DBI
        DBD::Pg

SUPPORT

This software is currently unsupported. It hasn't eaten my mailbox, but
I don't want to say it won't eat yours. But I find it useful, and you
might too.
