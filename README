Mail::Miner version 0.01a1
==========================

This is an EXCEPTIONALLY early alpha of Mail::Miner, but I'm releasing
it now, because it's immediately useful.

It doesn't even handle searches properly, but it will strip attachments
from emails, save them, and provide a means of restoring them. If you
install Mail::Miner and set it up so that mail is routed through
Mail::Audit::Miner (see the documentation) or piped through mm_process,
then attachments will be replaced by instructions about how to use the
"mm" command-line utility to detach them. You also have a handy database
of all your email that you can prod. :)

INSTALLATION

YOU WILL NEED MYSQL INSTALLED.

To install this module, create a new mysql database according to the
schema in miner.sql, and give yourself access to it. Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Now you have to make sure your incoming mail gets processed by
Mail::Miner. You can do this by putting a pipe to mm_process in your
procmailrc, or, if you're using Mail::Audit, by using
Mail::Audit::Miner. (Included in this distribution.) See the
documentation for that module for more details. 

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

        MIME::Parser
        Date::Manip
        Mail::Address
        DBI
        DBD::mysql

SUPPORT

THIS SOFTWARE IS EXTREMELY EARLY ALPHA. It probably won't eat your
mailbox. It hasn't eaten mine. If it did, I'd release a new version. But
it's not very featureful. That'll come in time. I don't want bug reports
or feature requests, or even patches, just yet. Once I've got something
that represents the complete Miner architecture, then I'll see about
user feedback. But for now, no mail, thanks.
